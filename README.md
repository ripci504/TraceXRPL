# TraceXRPL - proof of concept product authentication 

A proof of concept application that allows products to be linked to NFTs on the XRPL, immutably update and record production status, and verify authenticity of products. This is actively being worked on and in extremely early stages.

## Testing

To run the flask webserver, install the dependencies from the [pip_install.txt](./pip_install.txt) file using pip. Build the run.py file and visit the default 127.0.0.1:5000 URL. A testnet wallet will be created for you to mint NFTs.
