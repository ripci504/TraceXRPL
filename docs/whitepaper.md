# What is TraceXRPL (WIP)

## Introduction

The ability for producers to create non-fungible digital assets that represent physical products allow transparency in the supply chain and can prevent counterfeiting of goods. When properly used, NFTs on the XRPL are more than just images. They can immutably store data, such as information about a physical product, creating a layer of trust & authenticity for physical goods, tracking their lifecycle and increasing tracebility via decentralization.

## Use Cases

A consumer purchases, or preorders a bag online, and with their receipt they are able to claim an NFT that represents this bag. As the company produces the bag, each stage of production is represented & minted as an NFT that is connected to the consumers bag/NFT.  Using their NFTokenID, the consumer can then view their product history and authenticity online.

Populated by data from the XRPL, Product Metadata and Product History are stored as NFTs and can **not** be changed.
